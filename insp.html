	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091024184702/http://geocities.com/heatherfeather1883/index.html">HeatherFeather1883 (my fav!)</a>
	<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am OB. SESSED. with Heather's page. This might be my favourite webpage I found while reseraching. She has a sassy pic of herself, far too much personal information, and pages dedicated to her friends. Going back through the captures on archive.org, you can see her reverse-update her site, changing her details and picture.
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The simplicity of the site design is sort of endearing, and echoes what I tried to accept in my own. Heather's site may have been limited by her coding skill, as was mine, but she decorated where she could and it serves its purpose as a personal platform for her friends and family. I bet she was really cool for having her own site back in the day.
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090727215407/http://es.geocities.com/sakura_dreams02/?D=A">Natsumi Strawberry Candy (2004)</a>
	<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 15 year old 'Natsumi' has an about tab, a friends page with an icon to represent each friend, and a few blog posts. A couple containers to divide the page. Her coding skills are amazing for a 15 year old!
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091022050924/http://geocities.com/speakinghearts/Speaking_Hearts_INVITATION1.html">Speaking Hearts (2000)</a>
	<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A relatively lowkey site with pops of small animation that tie into the tiled background. This is the invitation page for a shared site with each page belonging to a family member or friend who has designed their bit. This can be seen by comparing Derek and Fran's invitation page (linked)- at the end Derek is credited for design and illustration, so he clearly had a lot of coding and digital knowledge- to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091025210843/http://geocities.com/js_mum1/index.html/">Mum's page</a>, a much simpler affair with no text decoration that I imagine was set up by Derek or someone else for their mum to use as a cyber-diary. She was probably a lot more unfamiliar with coding, but manages to upload a different image with each entry, pertinent to the topic.
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091022143505/http://geocities.com/paularegina24/blinkies1">PaulaRegina24, Christian 'about me' page</a>
	<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Paula has a huge amount of blinkies that show different parts of her personality- motherhood, her relationship, and her love for God.
	<li><a href="https://y2k.neocities.org/blinkies.html">Graphic Collection</a>
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neocities is a 2013 website builder/social media that aims to bring back the individuality of Geocities and other intricate DIY coded sites. I love the layout of this site, with the navigatory sidebar and the almost overwhelming gifs.
	<li><a href="https://plasticdino.neocities.org/blinkie/blinkies.html">Plastic Dino Blinkie Collection</a> + <a href="https://graphic.neocities.org/directory.html">Bonnibel's Graphic Collection</a> + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090810020118/http://geocities.com/lethal234/Fun.html">Lethal234</a> + <a href="https://99gifshop.neocities.org">99 Gif Shop</a>
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Various collections of blinkies and pixel animations.
	<li><a href="https://billsworld.neocities.org">Bill's World</a>
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the fact that this is hosted on the relatively new platform Neocities gives it away, Bill's site is a really good emulation of Y2K personal website design. It's a small touch in an incredibly detailed site, but I love the "links" section with all the crazy fonts leading to random pages not even on the site- just sharing things and friends' pages he likes. 
	<li><a href="https://combatbaby.neocities.org">Combat Baby</a>
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bryce has made his site look like a MySpace profile. He's made <a href="https://myspacebaby.neocities.org/home.html">another page here</a>, this one emo-inspired. The TyPiNg LiKe ThIs totally unlocked a memory in me, so he's to blame for the titles of my site.
	<li><a href="https://cinni.net">Cinni.net</a>
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While definitely fitting into a more 2012-15 Tumblr aesthetic rather than 'old internet', I included Cinni's page in this list because the function of the site is very much similar to what many Geocities sites were about: a personal platform showcasing your personality and interests. Cinni has plenty of painstaking, beautiful pages with collections of .GIFs and virtual dolls, a little diary page, links to offsites she enjoys (like Bill), and so much more. I don't know, it just makes me really happy. It's so special to come across something like this that's fairly anonymous but so personal- just looking at it reveals the obvious time and skill that went into this. That is what is very 'early internet' to me- stumbling into such a detailed snapshot of inner life from someone you will never know.
